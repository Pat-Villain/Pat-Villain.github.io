Pat Villamin's Project Portfolio

I am an Electrical Engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating at some point in the near future.
I like to mess around with old electrical componenets, especially things that have motors inside of them.

## Favorite CPSC Labs

* Lab 3 part 2

    I remember taking the whole in class lab time with Loc writing part 1. We thought part 2 wouldn’t be that bad, but ended up staying a whole afternoon bashing our heads against the keyboard to write out all of part 2. We struggled too much with the linting and formatting because we didn’t know how to properly do it/ what to look for yet.

* Lab 4 part 2

    This lab is one of my favorites, as it still used a lot of intuitive logic, and didn’t have as much complex of a concept, I remember feeling satisfied. However, looking back it seems very simple now; maybe rewriting this game to have more complex “gamerules” might be a fun challenge. This can easily turn into a battle-ship clone

* Lab 6 part 2

    Working on this lab with Ethan felt very satisfying, as we did it without a TA’s help on our own for 3 hours. I remember specifically writing in my notebook the math of blackjack to try to explain to Ethan (and myself) why we don’t need a “bust” function; this is one of the labs where I was clearly thinking too hard and ended up negatively impacting our team’s efficiency.
